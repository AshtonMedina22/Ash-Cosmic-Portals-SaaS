# 🔗 Link.bio Integration Solutions

## **❌ The Problem with Link.bio**

Link.bio doesn't allow custom HTML/JavaScript embedding, so we can't add our tracking script directly to their pages.

## **✅ Solution Options**

### **Option 1: Redirect Method (Recommended)**

**How it works:**
1. **Your NFC keychain** → `https://lnk.bio/PartyTimeTexas` (your existing page)
2. **Link.bio page** → redirects to your Cosmic Portals landing page
3. **Landing page** → tracks the visit and shows your content

**Setup:**
1. **Create a Cosmic Portals landing page** for Party Time Texas
2. **Update your link.bio page** to redirect to the Cosmic Portals URL
3. **Program your NFC keychain** to go to link.bio (as it does now)
4. **Link.bio redirects** to Cosmic Portals (with tracking)

**Benefits:**
- ✅ **Keep your existing keychain** - no reprogramming needed
- ✅ **Track all scans** - redirect method captures visits
- ✅ **Professional landing** - Cosmic Portals landing page
- ✅ **Full analytics** - every scan is tracked

### **Option 2: Direct Cosmic Portals URL**

**How it works:**
1. **Your NFC keychain** → Cosmic Portals landing page directly

3. **Full control** over landing page content

### **Option 3: Link.bio + Tracking Pixel**

**How it works:**
1. **Your NFC keychain** → `https://lnk.bio/PartyTimeTexas`
2. **Link.bio page** → includes a hidden tracking image
3. **Tracking image** → calls our API to record the scan

**Setup:**
1. **Add tracking image** to your link.bio page content
2. **Image URL:** `http://192.168.0.178:3000/api/track-pixel?deviceId=04:70:94:EA:9F:20:90`
3. **Scans are tracked** when the image loads

**Benefits:**
- ✅ **Keep link.bio** - no changes to your existing setup
- ✅ **Track scans** - via image loading
- ✅ **Simple implementation** - just add an image
